EXWM is the best thing since sliced bread. And this config proves that. It's
time to give in and use emacs for everything.

EXWM (Emacs X Windows Manager) is a package for Emacs that lets us manage X
Windows from the safety of emacs, with everything you'd expect from a tiling
window manager.

The features include:

    + Fully keyboard-driven operations
    + Hybrid layout modes (tiling & stacking)
    + Dynamic workspace support
    + ICCCM/EWMH compliance
    + (Optional) RandR (multi-monitor) support
    + (Optional) Builtin system tray
    + (Optional) Builtin input method

This module also includes a number of niceties from other packages, providing a
quite complete desktop experience; such as media key and brightness key support,
a /tray/, a built-in primitive daemon process manager

** Maintainers
+ [[https://github.com/elken][elken]] (Author)

** Module Flags
+ =+modeline-panel= Includes various segments to make the modeline function more like a panel
+ =+tray= Embed a tray in the minibufer of the current window to show tray icons

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][exwm]]

+ [[https://github.com/elken/doom-modeline-now-playing][doom-modeline-now-playing]] (=+modeline-panel=)

* Prerequisites
Should work out of the box, but a few extra packages are /recommended/

+ =picom=
  Fancy transparency and /rounded windows/

+ =flameshot=
  Best screenshot tool out there imo, supports area selection and
  drawing on the image

* Features
# An in-depth list of features, how to use them, and their dependencies.

* Configuration
This (surprisingly) is tweaked for my preference, but that doesn't mean it's
untouchable! Change this as needed, below are the more obvious areas I can think
of

** Background
Replace the =images/background.png= in the root doom directory

** Monitor Layout
Replace the =xrandr= shell command line with the configuration of your monitors

** EXWM Startup
Modify the =elken/exwm-init-hook= function to add any startup processes

** Window Titles
=elken/exwm-update-title= is the (trivial) function for controlling window titles

** Window Behaviour
=elken/configure-window-by-class= is the function that controls the default
behaviour for applications.

*NOTE*
Spotify doesn't work out of the box and requires [[https://github.com/dasJ/spotifywm][=spotifywm=]] to be installed separately.

* Troubleshooting
Running in debug mode (=--debug-init=) will also enable =exwm-debug= and make the
log more active. If this doesn't help, check the troubleshooting steps on the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#how-to-report-a-bug][exwm wiki]].
