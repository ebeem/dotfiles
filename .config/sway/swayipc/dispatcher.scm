;;            Binds  gesture  to  execute  the sway command command when detected.
;;            Currently supports the hold, pinch or swipe gesture. Optionally  can
;;            be limited to bind to a certain number of fingers or, for a pinch or
;;            swipe gesture, to certain directions.

;;        ┌───────┬─────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

;;        ├───────┼─────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
;;        │ swipe │  3 - 5  │ up, down, left, right                              │

;;        │ pinch │  2 - 5  │ all  above  + inward, outward, clockwise, counter‐ │
;;        │       │         │ clockwise                                          │
;;        └───────┴─────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

;;            The fingers can be limited to any sensible number or left  empty  to
;;            accept  any  finger  counts. Valid directions are up, down, left and
;;            right, as well as inward, outward, clockwise,  counterclockwise  for
;;            the pinch gesture. Multiple directions can be combined by a plus.

;;            If  a  input-device  is given, the binding will only be executed for
;;            that input device and will be executed instead of any  binding  that
;;            is  generic  to all devices. By default, if you overwrite a binding,
;;            swaynag will give you a warning. To silence this, use the  --no-warn
;;            flag.

;;            The  --exact  flag can be used to ensure a binding only matches when
;;            exactly all specified directions are matched and  nothing  more.  If
;;            there is matching binding with --exact, it will be preferred.

;;            The priority for matching bindings is as follows: input device, then
;;            exact  matches followed by matches with the highest number of match‐
;;            ing directions.

;;            Gestures executed while the pointer is above a bar are  not  handled
;;            by sway. See the respective documentation, e.g. bindgesture in sway-
;;            bar(5).

;;            Example:
;;                      # Allow switching between workspaces with left and right swipes
;;                      bindgesture swipe:right workspace prev
;;                      bindgesture swipe:left workspace next

;;                      # Allow container movements by pinching them
;;                      bindgesture pinch:inward+up move up
;;                      bindgesture pinch:inward+down move down
;;                      bindgesture pinch:inward+left move left
